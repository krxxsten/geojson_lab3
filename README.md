# LAB 3: Geojson
## Hospitals in Washington State

This repository contains the excersice and my own site that implements geoJSON data into a website. 

My site is a visualization of all hospital locations within Washington; including the hospital name, city, and zip code. I used a point formatted hospital location dataset provided from the **Washington Spatial Data** site, as well as, the polygon format of Washington state. Using both these files, I combined them to make create the visualization focused on the areas within Washington.
